I wanted to get a very minimalistic and clean look for the page, and keep it professional
looking at the same time. Chose to use very neutral colors (white, gray, black) as 
I felt like a turstworthy tourist site would not be filled with super bright colors overall.
The buttons used for the index and visit page however are colorful (and tuned to the color 
palette of the page) to grasp the users attention. 

What comes to the pages' individual color palettes, I decided to use colors that would match 
the hero images. Thus all the pages have some differences in the color palettes. I was using 
a lighter gray for the navigation bar to start with, but then decided to go darker as I felt
the text was not as easily readable as I wanted. The history page is definitely the plainest 
of the sites, but I did that intentionally - the page is very black and white, just like 
old films. 

I decided to go for a very simple and clear navigation bar that would stick to the top when scrolling
for easy access to other pages. It has the same font as the banners for consistency.

I encountered a bunch of problems while working on the site, and it surely took me a while
to get this together being my first site ever. Bootstrap destroyed my page layouts - I eneded up cutting
it down with the index and history page, and had to recode some part for the visit side to 
make it work. 

The map, although it works completely, doesn't want to change its size - i even removed the width and 
height stuff from the html code and tried to play around with it, without any success. It also jumped 
around without any clear changes from the code: sometimes it was on the middle of the page, and
sometimes leaning more to the left. I still don't know why. 

Another massive issue that i ran into was the text location in my footer, that I tried to 
solve with a demonstrator in a practical. I wanted the links to appear on the right side
of the footer, but could not make it work. I feel like there's a simple answer to it, but 
I just can't see it at the moment. 

I also wanted to implement grids to the first two pages, but then ran out of time. I think I will 
continue to develop this page after I've turned it in (on my computer, not on codio or git)
to see how to use those.
