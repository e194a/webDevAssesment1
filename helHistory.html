            <h2>Helsinki has a rich history - it has belonged to other coutries, and encountered multiple 
                wars, famine, and the plague. Due to its colorful history it has gone through periods influenced by
                different cultures. These can still be seen to this day, especially in architecture and the many museums 
                of the city.

            <h4> Helsinki under Swedish Rule </h4>
                <p> Helsinki was founded in 1550 by the Swedish king Gustav I Vasa (the then ruler of Finland) in order to 
            compete with the Estonian markets. Helsinki however remained a small fishing town with only 4,000 habitant, 
            and got ravaged by the plague, hunger and war agaisnt Russians in the 16th century. During this period, Suomenlinna, a sea fortress 
            in front of the town was built to grant protection from the east, but the town was still burned down in 1808 by the inviding Russians,
                to whom Finland was ceced the following year.</p>

            <h4>Helsinki under Russian Rule</h4>
                <p>Helsinki replaced Turku as the capital of Finland in 1812 by the orders of the tsar Alexander I. The center was completely rebuilt
            by Johan Albrecht Ehrenstrom and Carl Ludwig Engel, who designed the city's impressive Neoclassical buildings, including the 
            Senate Square buildings and its Cathedral, Tuomiokirkko. By the 20th century Helsinki had become the biggest academic, 
            administrative and industrial hub in the country with a population of over 100,000 people and growing amount international and cultural 
            activities.

                <br>
            With growing popularity of fine arts, such as opera and classical music, so grew the nationalism of the Finns. Nationalism was
            present in architecture, which can especially seen in the jugend houses in the southern parts of the city, such as Katajannokka and
            Ullanlinna.</p>

            <h4>Independent Helsinki</h4>
                <p>Finland declared its independence in 1917, which was followed by a period of warfare - first a year long civil war, and then two
                separate wars against Russia, the Winter War (1939-1940) and the Continuation War (1941-1944), but Helsinki managed to survive without 
                any major damage. After the wars people started to move into bigger cities, which led to the development of suburban areas around central 
                Helsinki. Finnish architecture continued to thrive with the lead of Alvar Aalto, who designed Finlandia Hall (Finlandiatalo) among other 
                things. The National Opera Hall and the Contemporary museum were all built during this time. </p>
                    <br>
                <p>Helsinki has hosted multiple internationally important events. The first summit between US and the Soviet Union, with George Bush
                and Mikhail Gorbachev, took place in 1990, and Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin followed in their footprints in 2018. Helsinki has 
                become known for its design and technology scene, homing many known companies, such as Supercell and Marimekko.
